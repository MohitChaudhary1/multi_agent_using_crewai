# ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent System using CrewAI

Welcome to the **Multi-Agent System using CrewAI** project! This repository showcases the implementation of a collaborative multi-agent framework leveraging the capabilities of [CrewAI]. The system is designed to demonstrate how multiple AI agents can work together to accomplish complex tasks efficiently.

## ðŸ§  Overview

In this project, we define a set of autonomous agents, each assigned specific roles and responsibilities. These agents collaborate to perform tasks that would be challenging for a single agent to handle alone. The modular design ensures scalability and adaptability to various problem domains.
